/*
 * Frederick Gifford
 * CPSC-60000 Week 5 State Pattern
 * Since my final project is a simple Checkers game, I wanted to try to implement the State pattern
 * As a way to keep track of the state of each square on the Checkers board, whether that be Red, Black,
 * RedPromoted, BlackPromoted, or Empty. This will be a simple implementation that just prints statements, but
 * The final project will be able to make algorithm changes based on the state about what the legal moves will be.
